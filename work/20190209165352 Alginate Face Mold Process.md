## Alginate Face Mold Process

1.	Melt Texclay before starting process
    * Put in oven at 200 degrees
    * in first attempt, texclay took too long to melt, around 25 minutes, and was not liquid enough for proper pouring
2.	Prepare model
    * Shower cap
    * layer of lotion on facial hair
    * clothes that can be ruined or cover up
    * all exposed hair covered with plastic wrap
    * dropcloth under chair
3.	Prepare materials
    * plaster bandages cut
        * bucket of warm water for bandages
    * alginate in tub, warm water ready to pour for mix
        * see below for measurements
4.	Mix alginate
    * first attempt mixed 8oz of alginate, exact measurement on bag for 4-1 water weight to alginate weight, or 8oz alginate to 32 fl.oz. Water.  Mix was far too runny.  Mix can be mixed as dry as 3-1 water to alginate.  Also, 8oz was far more than necessary.
    * Attempt#2: Try 5oz alginate, split difference on mix? 3.5-1 water to alginate?  Or 3-1?  3.5-1=17.5fl.oz=2.2cups,3-1=15fl.oz.=1.875cups
5.	Apply alginate
    * first attempt, didn't get alginate properly into all details,especially the eyes.  Also, after alginate congealed into curdled look applied more-do not do this, it will not stick. Also, make sure absolutely no hair get covered with alginate.
    * Apply alginate quickly, about Â¼ inch thick. One person apply, one person makes sure forced into details? Nostrils, eyes and mouth taken care of first, and then top to bottom.  Finish up when feel alginate thickening, make expression, begin application of plaster bandages. Do not apply more alginate after coagulation, and try to some bandages applied before this point as well so they stick.
    * Did not properly time alginate setting first time, make sure to do this.
6.	Apply plaster bandages
    * Nose first, and them two overlapping layers over layer of alginate.
    * Once bandages are hard, mask can be removed carefully.
