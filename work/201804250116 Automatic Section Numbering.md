#### Automatic Section Numbering

Especially when your text is large enough for needing a table of contents, it is a good idea to number your sections. This can be done automatically as follows:

* from the edit menu select `Insert Section Numbers`
* press <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>

Automatically inserted section numbers will look like in the following note:

```markdown
# 1  201711250024 Working with tocs
tags = #sublime_zk #toc

## 1.1  This is a very long note!
At least we pretend so.

## 1.2  It contains many headings
That's why we are going to need a table of contents.

### 1.2.1  **with funny chäråcters!**
Funny characters can be a challenge in the `(#references)`.

## 1.3  as can duplicate headers

# 2  as can duplicate headers
```

**Note:** You can refresh the section numbers at any time by repeating the above command.

**Note:** To switch off numbered sections, use the command `Remove Section Numbers` from the edit menu.
