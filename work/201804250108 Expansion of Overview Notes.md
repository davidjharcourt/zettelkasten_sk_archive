### Expansion of overview notes with selective refresh

#### Expansion of overview notes

Let's say you have an overview note about a topic that links to specifics of that topic that looks like this:

```markdown
O - Text production

This is an **overview note** about text production with the Zettelkasten method.

A few general words about our tool: Sublime ZK
[[201711111707]] Sublime ZK is awesome
[[201711111708]] Sublime ZK is great

Then we go more in-depth:
[[201711111709]] The specifics of how we produce text with the plugin

Cool!
```

This overview is just a collection of note links with brief descriptions and a bit of additional text.

Now, if you wanted to turn this overview note into a text containing the contents of the linked notes instead of just the links, then you can *expand* the note like this:

* Use the Tools menu: Tools > Expand Overview Note
* <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>

You will be asked for the name of your new overview note et voila! Depending on your linked notes, the overview note will be expanded into a new note

The lines containing note links are replaced by the contents of their corresponding notes, enclosed in comment lines. You can now edit and save this file to your liking.


**Note**: If you want to refresh this expanded overview later, then please leave those comments in!

**Note:**: If you modify the text of a linked note (between comment lines), then remove the extra `!` to prevent your change to get overwritten when [refreshing](#refreshing-an-expanded-overview-note) this overview.


#### Refreshing an expanded overview note

It might happen that you change some notes that are already expanded into your new expanded overview note. If that happens and you have left the comments in, then you can refresh the expanded overview:

* Use the Tools menu: Tools > Refresh expanded Note
* <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>

**Note:** Only notes with comments starting with `<!-- !` will be considered for a refresh.

**Tip:** That means: To keep your edits of specific expanded notes from being overwritten by a refresh, just delete the extra `!`, making the comment start with `<!-- `. Alternatively, you can, of course, delete the comment lines for parts you are sure will never need refreshing.
