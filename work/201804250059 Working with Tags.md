### Working with tags

#### Getting an overview of all your tags
Over time you might collect quite a number of **#tags** assigned to your notes. Sometimes it helps to get an overview of all of them, maybe to check for synonyms before creating a tag, etc.

When you press `#!` (that is the `#` key followed by the `!` key) quickly, the search results will list all your #tags right next to your text.


#### Inserting Tags
Press `#+?` to ask for a list of all tags used in your note archive. You can narrow down the search and finally pick the tag you like.

#### Searching for notes containing specific tags
Like note-links, tags can also be "followed" by clicking them. This will produce a list of notes tagged with that tag in the search results area.
