##Idea:

Developing a relentless solution-focused approach is phase 3. I have been fortunate to have worked with some incredibly successful individuals. Whether they are professional athletes or corporate executives, I always try to elicit what those individuals believe to be the top reasons that they have been able to rise above the masses and achieve extraordinary accomplishments. I have noticed that one trait that truly successful people have in common is that they have developed and maintained a solution-focused approach in their careers and in life. 

Phase 3 teaches individuals how to develop a relentless focus on solutions. The solution-focused model, Always have a solution on the board, is illustrated through real-life narratives and results. Athletes and coaches are able to realize the small difference between good and great by asking, What is one thing I can do that could make this better? 

The solution focus offers a reliable tool for reaching and exceeding one's potential. 

* Always have a solution on the board: A results-driven model that identifies the biological and environmental obstacles to achieving greatness. 
* What is one thing I can do that could make this better?: A concrete method of overcoming all obstacles and making success a permanent state.
