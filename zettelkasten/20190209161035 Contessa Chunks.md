>She meets the rebel leader, who speaks of rumors of a rebellion, and that some of the      >refugees are actually escapees. Contessa opens the book, which seems to be changed, but >it empty. She decides to make it a journal and begins to write questions in it, but the book >responds to her questions, giving her answers and telling her parts of the story of the  >history of the land and logos, as well as it’s current state.
