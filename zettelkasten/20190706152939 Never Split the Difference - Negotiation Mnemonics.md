##Never Split the Difference - Negotiation Mnemonics
##Connections:
[[20190706153658]] Never Split the Difference - Book Notes - Index
##Idea:
This note is some visual mnemonics I was creating for the negotiation steps from *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss.


	* Mirroring - You see your reflection in a mirror
	* Labelling - You put a label on it that says mirror
	* Proactively state the negatives - You put a label on the reflection of you that says idiot
	* No begins the negotiationYour reflection says book nooo!
	* Summarize, get to "That's right!"
