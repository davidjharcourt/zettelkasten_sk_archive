“ 10-Minute Toughness is a solid mental training program. In fact I feel it is the best of its kind. . . . [It's] what the title says: ten minutes a day that connects your talents and abilities to the outcome you're seeking. As a retired NFL player looking forward, I can see as many applications for the toughness Jason Selk's program brought out of me in the business world as there were on the football field.”

-- Jeff Wilkins , Former NFL Pro Bowl Kicker

“The mental side of the game is extremely important. 10-Minute Toughness helps the players develop the mental toughness needed for success; it really makes a difference.”

-- Walt Jocketty , General Manager of the 2006 World Champion St. Louis Cardinals

“Jason Selk has spent a tremendous amount of time and energy developing effective mental-training programs and coaches workshops. He is truly committed to helping individuals and teams to perform at their very best, when it really counts.”

-- Peter Vidmar , Olympic Gold Medalist

Mental training is a must for high performance both on the field and off. But simply hoping for mental toughness isn't going to build any mind muscles. You need a proven routine of daily exercises to get you where you want to go. 10-Minute Toughness is your personal coach for boosting brainpower and achieving a competitive edge in whatever game you play. With quickness and ease, you'll learn how to master your own mind and psych out your opponents using personalized techniques from one of America's most successful sport psychology consultants. Like no other program available, the 10-Minute Toughness (10-MT) routine gets you ready for the competition in just ten minutes a day.

3.0 out of 5 stars it's OK
June 25, 2014
Verified Purchase
I found the book very interesting especially the 10 minute toughness routine/practice. The one thing I questioned is the part of positive affirmations. While they are important the book does not address the emotional aspects of high performance and how the emotional baggage we bring to our goals undermines our ability to succeed.

I believe this is a good tool to have but one needs to have a thorough understanding of their emotional states and how these impact performance despite the rational/logical side of the brains' rationale. In the end, imho, it is the subconscious that directs our behaviors and potential performance. Only by making peace and accepting who we are and what activates the various emotional states will we be able to live and function in spite the maladaptive behaviors we bring to the table.

3.0 out of 5 stars good book, good ideas
December 1, 2014
Format: Kindle Edition Verified Purchase
Regardless of what you read about this it is 90% sports focus. You can apply this anywhere, but he offers a paucity of translation help.

The power is in his systemizing existing knowledge, and he does it well. The first half of the book is considerably stronger than the 2nd half.

All in all recommended, almost gave this 4 stars.

2.0 out of 5 stars Meant for Athletes NOT the Rest of Us.
January 24, 2019
Format: Hardcover Verified Purchase
I purchased this book to be used in everyday life and did not find it to be helpful. This book is definitely geared to be used by athletes. While there are passing references to non-sports topics, they are few and far between. If you an athlete looking for a book to improve mental performance, this is probably a great place to start. If you are looking for a book to be used in everyday life, or to improve work performance, this is not the book to read.

5.0 out of 5 stars Such a practical way to pursue excellence
July 22, 2010
Format: Hardcover Verified Purchase
This is such a practical way to approach performance excellence, no matter what field you apply it to. Sports, business, lifestyle - anything you want to truly change in your life, any goal you really want to pursue, the 10-MT program is the way to go.

In the few weeks since using it, I've achieved two goals that I wasn't sure I had the capability to achieve: a 1 hour 46 minute half marathon, and a sub 23 minute 5km. It might not be that impressive to a real athlete, but they represent huge improvements in my recreational running. And I'm setting bigger goals than I ever thought I would, in my 40s.

One of the biggest ways that 10-MT helped me achieve these goals was to take my mind OFF the goals themselves (after defining them) and focusing instead on the way I need to perform to achieve them. So instead of starting a race thinking "I will cross the line in under 1 hour 50 minutes" I'm thinking "shoulders are soft, centre is strong, legs and light and quick". 10-MT has been making my training and races much more enjoyable and much more gratifying.

The best book I've read so far (of about half a dozen) on achieving personal excellence.

I have red a few mental training books and this is the one to get. Has a very clear easy to follow system that worked for me. Well written, to the point, and logical in the process. If you are serious about including a mental training system in the sport of your choice I highly recommend you read this book.

5.0 out of 5 stars Best mental guidance system available
June 23, 2011
Format: Hardcover Verified Purchase
This book tells you what you need to do to create the life you want. It's simple, it's easy, and it's designed to be used to create a 10-minute daily mental program that can be modified and used to consistently achieve anything you want, one day at a time.

I read this book after a six year long study of performance psychology texts and interviews. I read the books Overachievement, Mental Toughness, and With Winning in Mind. These are all excellent books, but they only really graze the surface of what you really need to know and do. Emphasis should be placed on "do," because this is really where you learn what you need to know anyway. Any book can tell you to only focus on controlling what you can control (and stop worrying about what you cannot control, such as the score, the weather, the opponent's still level, etc). But few books teach you how to determine what you can control and how to create performance specific goals so you can continuously improve yourself in the areas of highest importance.

The best part about this book is its explanation of product goals and process goals. It explains the "paradox of product goals" which is only hinted at in other books (if it isn't missed completely). In my opinion this is the conceptual crux of this book, for it teaches you how to focus on process goals but do regular assessments of product goals to see if you're heading in the right direction. No other book I've read on self-help or psychology gets you up to speed with this, let alone so rapidly and precisely.

I loved 10-Minute Toughness and love how the author designed it for use. If you read it a couple of times, follow Jason's directions, and DO the 10 minute program every single day, you WILL notice the difference. And it will be a big one.
