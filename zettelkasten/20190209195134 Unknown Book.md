## Unknown Book

**These are notes I took for a screenplay or book I was trying to write back when Natalie lived in St.Bernard. All I have are out of order scene one line descriptions, but many of them refer to old stories and ideas that could be reused**

* Urn
    * Rosemary Plath
    * Custodian finds in dumpster in box
    * builds an altar for the ashes
    * *I left mom on the table* (Not sure what this meant)
* Jack watches *A Cypher in the Snow*
    * This was a horrifying movie from the seventies or early eighties they made us watch in gradeschool, I think to show bullying was wrong or something.  It was on a reel to reel projector. This kid walks off the bus one day and dies because no one was nice to him.
    * I'm still convinced they also showed us a movie where everyone in the school got sick because one kid put their mouth on the water fountain.
