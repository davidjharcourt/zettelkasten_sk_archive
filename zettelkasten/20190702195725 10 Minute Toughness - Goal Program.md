##Idea:

Phase 2 comprises developing and utilizing an effective goal-setting program. Typically, when coaches and athletes attempt to create a goals program, it turns out to be an hour of writing down goals at the beginning of the season and then revisiting those goals at the end of the season. The 10-MT goals program teaches athletes and coaches how to enhance motivation and performance by integrating goals into everyday training sessions and competition. 

* Vision clarity: Ultimate goal accomplishment associated with sport. 
* Product goal: A result-oriented goal that is clearly measurable and is usually most effective if it emphasizes accomplishments in the next twelve months. 
* Process goal: The daily action needed to accomplish both product-and vision-level goals.
* Success Log: Questions that encourage the identification of personal strengths and specific desires for improvement. 
* Personal Rewards Program Questionnaire: Questionnaire that identifies the athlete's motivational preferences. 
* Personal incentive style: The motivational preferences of athletes that enhance training and competition intensity. 

The 10-MT goals program helps athletes and coaches identify individual and team vision clarity, as well as product goals and process goals. In addition, Success Logs are used to improve daily goal emphasis. Athletes also complete the Personal Rewards Program Questionnaire to identify the personal incentive style that produces the ideal motivational impact for training and competition intensity.
