The problem, as Ben Shapiro puts it in this must-read, is that “because conservatives don’t think about how to win that they constantly lose” in confrontations with leftists. The solution is to stop taking the bullying and learning to argue for victory.
Among Shapiro’s rules for beating the left in confrontations are:
Be willing to take a punch. (conservatives tend to shy away from confrontations because the left is rhetorically violent; but it is important “to walk toward the fire.” )
Hit hard, hit first. (leftists stage muggings; instead of fighting by Marquis of Queensberry rules, conservatives need to accept the strategy Mike Tyson: “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”)
Immediately frame the debate. (“When you’re discussing global warming , for example, the proper question is not whether man is causing global warming but whether man can fix global warming—a question to which the universally acknowledged answer is no unless we are willing to revert to the pre industrial age.”)
There are eight more rules that will allow a conservative to debate a leftist and destroy him. How to Debate Leftists and Destroy Them is not just a “how to” book. It is a survival manual.

2.0 out of 5 stars Poorly written
August 6, 2018
Format: Kindle Edition Verified Purchase
While I was excited about the premise of this book, it feels like it was thrown together. The grammar is terrible. Typos out the wazoo. Shorter than I anticipated but I ended up being glad about that because it was so painful to read. Most of the arguments were barely supported. I did pick up a few good tips ( hardly 11 though) so that's the only reason I didn't give it one star. Sorry Ben.

5.0 out of 5 stars I'll share this treasure of a book with every open-minded person I know.
September 20, 2018
Format: Kindle Edition Verified Purchase
I cherish Ben's ideas and values. And, if only I'd one nano-fraction of his intellect.... but .... reading him is way easier than listening to him. Maybe it's a geriatric thing that only applies to slower brains such as mine; when Ben speaks (see YouTube) he leaves me gasping for oxygen. He jam-packs every spoken paragraph with cascades of complex ideas and facts. This would be fine even for the likes of me. Or it would be if only he would just slow down his word delivery rate and modulate his voice to something a tad less like machine gun fire. Now this book, on the other hand, is a whole other thing. Concise, carefully considered and well-paced, thus making, easy and quick to read and recall. This of course makes it super- accessible. I have to buy a hard copy so I don't have to loan out my Kindle. Each of my fellow right-wing extremists (tasteless joke here) and my more open-minded, lefty mates need to read it. What a brilliant summary of modern political sanity this is! Normally I avoid political argumenta like the plague. Especially with the loonier left. -- that wall of simmering righteousness is usually too daunting. However, now that I have taken Ben's condensed crash course in rational political sanity my mind is on fire. I can now at least consider joining the polarised debate that is killing our democracy.

August 1, 2018
Format: Kindle Edition Verified Purchase
I bought this book so I could have a better understanding of how to properly respond to someone on the left when debating them. The book is absolutely helpful. It basically has different rules to remember while debating some on the left. The rules are easy to remember and makes a lot of sense. Ben uses examples from his debates where he implemented the rules and was successful. Overall good book if you are looking for guidance on how to beat anyone on the left in a debate.

3.0 out of 5 stars Rather basic material
June 4, 2018
Format: Kindle Edition Verified Purchase
This was mostly how to knock out a liberal before they get a good punch. The assumption is that all their arguments are specious and won't stand up to a serious argument. A quick little book with many good points, but not a lot of fodder for the cannon.

I’m not a liberal or a conservative, but I thought I might get a couple useful tips - or at least understand more about how conservatives practice the art of debate. There’s really nothing here of value. It would have been light as a Medium article. As a Kindle single, it’s a ripoff.

If you find yourself talking to leftists, you will find yourself dealing with their tactic of personal destruction. It's what they do. It's literally all they have and their assaults are predictable. Shapiro talls about being prepared. He talks about how to do so. If you're defending yourself against leftist character assassination, you need this book now. It's a quick, empowering read.

5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful Short Read About Political Debate
December 1, 2018
Format: Kindle Edition Verified Purchase
I knew this book would be great as soon as I saw it. I watch Ben Shapiro debates and lectures all the time.

This short read is great for setting up to debate someone. These steps can be used in all types of debate. I actually read the book in the same way Mr. Shapiro speaks! LoL

Take notes, highlight great points he made, outline them, then research! Knowledge is key here.

I highly recommend this book. I would also encourage those who teach debate to read the book. Use it as a study guide, or in a classroom debate.
