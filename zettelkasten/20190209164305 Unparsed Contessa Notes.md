Do you like TV? I guess it’s okay…my mom only lets me watch an hour a day…It’s mostly boring. I prefer the commercials.
Here, take a TV pill. Only the best programs.
I have a rule never to take mysterious pills from odd looking strangers with windup keys on their backs.
Well, if it’s a rule.  Do you like TV?
What’s your favorite show? Whatever’s on. Mine too!

Cell phones, blue tooth, photo documentation, instant nostalgia
