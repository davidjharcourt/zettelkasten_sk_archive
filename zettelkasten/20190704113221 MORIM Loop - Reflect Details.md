##MORIM Loop - Reflect Details
##Connections:
[[20190704111942]] MORIM Loop
##Idea:
**Reflect**

	* Expand the model
	* Analyse the observations
	* What does that imply?
	* How?
	* What are the Risks?
	* What else?
	* How does that fit together?
	* Is my model correct or not?
	* Need to be able to find Risks that other people haven't found. People can find business risks, project management risks, we need to find the technical risks of putting these things together beyond the developer perspective.
