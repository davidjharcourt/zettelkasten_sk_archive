##Idea:

Thinking about a problem from an inverse perspective. 

For example, the inverse of being right more is being wrong less.

Carl Jacobi was a nineteenth-century German mathematician who often used to say, “Invert, always invert” (actually he said, “Man muss immer umkehren,” because English wasn’t his first language). He meant that thinking about a problem from an inverse perspective can unlock new solutions and strategies.
