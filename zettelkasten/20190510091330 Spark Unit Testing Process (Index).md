##Spark Unit Testing Process (Index)
##Connections:

##Idea:
I need to produce process documentation for how we do our unit/integration testing process for Spark/Hadoop.

This should include:
* How to build a test input table in hadoop
* How to map that table to a list of unit tests in a spreadsheet (Jason loves spreadsheets, but says we can use something else. I think it's a good choice.)
* How we execute the list of unit tests on Hadoop
* How we capture the test result output for each test - viewing pass/failure
* How we organize all of the above "things" into an artifact that can be stored in QC (will be rally, or sharepoint) as QA test evidence
* Future state these would be automated on every deployment
