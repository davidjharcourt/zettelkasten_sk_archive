**This note needs some additional input from my other Cornell notes notes. Also, I don't think I got the cues part right. And there should be a place in the note for next actions. Is that the cues?**

Section to the left is for "Cues", key words or phrases you pick up during the meeting.

Larger section to right is for actual Note-taking.

	1. Record: During the lecture, use the notetaking column to record the lecture using telegraphic sentences.
	2. Questions: As soon after class as possible, formulate questions based on the notes in the right-hand column. Writing questions helps to clarify meanings, reveal relationships, establish continuity, and strengthen memory. Also, the writing of questions sets up a perfect stage for exam-studying later.
	3. Recite: Cover the notetaking column with a sheet of paper. Then, looking at the questions or cue-words in the question and cue column only, say aloud, in your own words, the answers to the questions, facts, or ideas indicated by the cue-words.
	4. Reflect: Reflect on the material by asking yourself questions, for example: “What’s the significance of these facts? What principle are they based on? How can I apply them? How do they fit in with what I already know? What’s beyond them?
	5. Review: Spend at least ten minutes every week reviewing all your previous notes. If you do, you’ll retain a great deal for current use, as well as, for the exam. 
    
Bottom section is for a Summary of the meeting.

    * After class, use this space at the bottom of each page to summarize the notes on that page.
