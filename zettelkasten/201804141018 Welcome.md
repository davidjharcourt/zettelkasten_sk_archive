## Markdown Formatting

We have **bold**, *italic*, ***bold italic***, and `inline code`, too.

There are also code blocks:

    created by either block-indenting text
    with 4 spaces or a tabulator;

Inserting links is as easy as this: [some reference](https://zettelkasten.de).

We can cite interesting books like [@FastZettelkastenmethode2015], and add the one or other footnote[^1].

> Blockquotes are indicated using email-style '>' angle brackets.
> more of those

I prefer fenced code blocks with a dark background:

```basic
10 PRINT "--- THIS IS SUBLIME_ZK C= 64 ---"
29 GOTO 10
```

[^1]: The funny footnote.
